    <h3>Competition</h3>
    <section class="subsection">
        <p><strong>PayPal:</strong> with PayPal a user can have a virtual wallet that can be used to buy online. Although you can't recharge your transport card/mobile directly within the app. Also, PayPal doesn't offer any kind of discout and/or sale. At least not as often as D'Wallet do.</p>
